### Howdy 👋

I'm Aussie Frost, welcome to my GitHub!
- 🚵 Data and software engineering is my main thing, but I also love going outdoors, making music, photography, and hanging with my friends and pup 🐶!
- 🌱 I created and published [anonymizePy](https://pypi.org/project/anonymizePy/), a package to help anyone remove personally identifying information from their data with ease.
- 🧠 I built a [whole-brain SVM classification pipeline](https://github.com/ausdfrost/round_robin_person_decoding) for the Computational Social Neuroscience Lab at the University of Oregon.
- 💬 Hope you like my projects, and feel free to say hi! --> [ausdfrost@gmail.com](mailto:ausdfrost@gmail.com)
