### Howdy 👋

I'm Aussie Frost, a fourth year Data Science student at the University of Oregon!
- 🌱 I'm an alum of Rob Chavez's *Computational Social Neuroscience Lab* where I built a [predictive model](https://github.com/austinfroste/round_robin_person_decoding) on a [group dynamics study](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1izPhEpN1qDBnrQXxh3ieCiWiWzlfmrl1/view) (using fMRI)!
- 🚵 Data is my main thing, but I also love going outdoors, making music, and hanging with my friends and pup 🐶!
- 💬 Feel free to say hi! -> afrost6@uoregon.edu
